# What is SurakSA

Whenever we move to a new locality or visit a new locality we are unaware about the danger or potential danger zone in that area. To control or contain such areas, We have developed an application which lets you mark those areas(if you experienced something very wrong in that area) and also let you call the cops in SOS situations. In this way it will help the person who is visiting that area for the first or unaware about the area. This will also help cops, filter out those danger areas and with frequent patrolling such areas can be made safer again!


## Project Description

Our application surakSA helps users to identify the unsafe locations and displays it on a map and thus take care of users safety. Users can mark an area as unsafe if they have a bad experience in that area. We have also added an SOS option where users will be able to video call cops in case of emergency situations.
